Pascal/Camel Case to Snake Case Converter
This Python script converts Pascal or Camel cased strings to snake case. It's a useful tool for developers working with naming conventions across different coding styles. The convert_to_snake_case function efficiently handles the conversion by identifying uppercase characters and inserting underscores as needed.

How it works:
The convert_to_snake_case function takes a Pascal or Camel cased string as input.
It iterates over each character in the input string, checking if it's uppercase.
If the character is uppercase, it appends an underscore followed by the lowercase version of the character.
If the character is lowercase, it appends the character as is.
Finally, it joins all the characters together into a single string, effectively converting the string to snake case.
